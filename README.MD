#AI Knowledge Works
The **AI Knowledge Works** project provides a suite of template  Automation Bots, implemented in Tungsten RPA, to create, update and maintain an Azure AI Search knowledge base, for use in a Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern.

The Automation Bots are intended to complement and extent TotalAgility workflows, bringing the full power of generative AI to both ChatBot style interactions with humans, as well as providing a for applied use of LLMs and Generative AI as part of enterprise Intelligent Automation projects.

##Included Template & Examples

 - Embedding - vector embeddings using Azure hosted Open AI models
 - RAG
 - Zero Shot Classification/Extraction/Decisioning - using chat completions interactions with Azure hosted Open AI models
- Few Shot training for Classification/Extraction/Decisioning - using chat completions interactions with Azure hosted Open AI models, illustrating using System messages to embed few-shot training data
 - Creating data sources / indexes / skills & indexers in Azure AI Search
 - Pushing TotalAgility extracted data / data models into existing AI Search index


##Required Technology Components

 - Tungsten Automation RPA (on-premise or RPA Cloud)
 - Azure Subscription
 - Access to OpenAI models on Azure
